Intro: If you asked me what a designer is when I was a kid, I would probably reply: “someone that designs clothes”. I met web design when I was 14.

As I dived deeper into web design I learned that design is a very general word. I started drawing interfaces in Photoshop and that must be the time when I realized that I had a mind of a designer for my whole life. Before, I used to draw and make my own toys from everything I got my hands on, from cardboard & paper to the Lego blocks. I was building robots and rockets long before they started a range of products for that.

(quote: Is what people used to tell me. text: They should hire you to come up with new ideas for products.)


Design is about building / creating something. But it’s not about creation itself. Creativity is not enough - artists are creative, but nobody actually uses their art. They just admire it. So you could say that design is about creating something useful. And that’s what I have been doing since my early childhood.

I always envied schoolmates that knew exactly what they’d want to be when they grow up, simply because I didn’t know that for myself. But the answer was right in front of me all the time. I just didn’t know the word for it - designer.
