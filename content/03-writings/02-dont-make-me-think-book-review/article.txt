Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug is probably the best book about web usability. It's one of the books every web designer should read and keep it on the bookshelf. The book was first released in 2000, so it's actually 12 years old. But it hasn't sold more than 300.000 copies for nothing.

##"Don't Make Me Think!"

Steve Krug starts off by telling that this is his first law of usability. If there's a rule that web designers should try to find space in their heads for, it's this one.

(quote: Steve Krug also suggests. text: Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what's left.)

What he means with this rule is that the Web page should be self-evident, obvious, self-explanatory. Everyone should be able to "get it" - what it is and how to use it - without expending any effort thinking about it.

Steve quickly explains it better with two really good examples. Use of words for links and style of links / buttons.

He also gives a nice example with the search functionality on websites, which often seems to be overcomplicated for no particular reason. Here are some more examples of questions that users should never spend their time thinking about:

- Where am I?
- Where should I begin?
- Where did they put ___?
- What are the most important things on this page?
- Why did they call it _that_?

##How  We Really Use the Web

Anyone, who has spent some time studying users while using the web, will have a good idea of how users _really_ use it. You can even try to study yourself when you're searching for something on the web. you'll see that we all fall in this pattern. We never really read the web pages, we scan them.

**Here are 3 facts of life as Steve calls them:**

1. We don't read pages. We scan them.
2. We don't make optimal choices. We satisfice.
3. We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through.

##How Can We Help the User?

Steve goes on with suggesting these five ways to help the user finding what he's looking with scanning the page. 

**Create a Clear Visual Hierarchy**
The more important something is, the more prominent it is. It's as simple as that. For example, the most important headings are either larger and bolder. Make things that are related logically also related visually. Visually nesting things makes it easier to understand what's part of what.

**Take Advantage of Conventions**
Every medium has it's own conventions. Web design got it's mostly from newspapers and magazines. What is a convention? A user can understand what each part of the website is, even if it's in a foreign language.

**Break Pages Up Into Clearly Defined Areas**
Clearly define what each part of the web page is by using backgrounds, whitespace, borders and other elements. It's as simple as that.

**Make it Obvious What's Clickable**
It's very annoying when you don't know where to click to get the full story. It's like that for everyone so avoid it. Links should be underlined, buttons should clearly be buttons. In this era, when flat design is very popular, this is a very important guideline.

**Minimie Noise**
Steve categorizes the noise into two categories. Busy-ness and Background noise. The former is when everything screams for attention and a user doesn't know what to focus on. The latter is when lots of tiny bits make it a little harder to scan through the page.

##And a Lot More

This is a great book, although it' short. Or maybe because of that. Every chapter offers great theory combined with great examples. I read this book twice and I always pick up something new from it.
